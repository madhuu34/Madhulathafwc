    # then the charge Q on the top plate is initially negative, so V_C = (Q_bottom - Q_top)/C = (-Q_top)/C
    # Or, if Q is the charge on the plate connected to the inductor where current enters from,
    # and Vc is defined as voltage across capacitor from top to bottom, then Vc = Q_top / C.
    # From the diagram, Vc is across the capacitor with '+' at the bottom.

    # In the diagram, 'i' flows into the top plate. Let Q be the charge on the top plate.
    # Then Vc = V_bottom - V_top. If V_bottom is positive, V_top is negative.
    # So Q_top is negative. Vc = Q_bottom / C = -Q_top / C.

    # Let's stick to the convention where I = dQ/dt and Vc = Q/C.
    # If Vc(0) = 100V and the positive terminal is at the bottom, then the charge on the bottom plate is +Q_0.
    # The charge on the top plate is -Q_0.
    # If current 'i' flows clockwise (as indicated), it means positive charge is flowing out of the bottom plate
    # and into the top plate (from the inductor side).
    # Let Q be the charge on the plate where current 'i' flows *into* (the top plate).
    # Then V_top - V_bottom = Q/C. So V_bottom - V_top = -Q/C.
    # Given Vc(0) = 100V across the capacitor with + at the bottom, so V_bottom - V_top = 100V.
    # So, 100 = -Q(0)/C => Q(0) = -100 * C = -Vc0 * C.
